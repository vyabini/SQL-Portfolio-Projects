# SQL-Portfolio-Projects
All the datasets were explored using SQL server

As part of the learning, few simple case studies have been picked and analysed to get more acquainted with writing SQL queries.
With more progress, I have also worked on 4 case study projects of Danny ma's 8WeekSQLChallenge which made the learning process more challenging and interesting.
